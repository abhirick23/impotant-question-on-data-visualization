# impotant-question-on-data-visualization

Michael Friendly defines data visualization “as information which has been abstracted in some schematic form, including attributes or variables for the units of information.” In other words, it is a coherent way to visually communicate quantitative content. Depending on its attributes, the data may be represented in many different ways, such as a line graph, bar chart, pie chart, scatter plot, or map.

Data visualization is a form of communication that portrays dense and complex information in graphical form. The resulting visuals are designed to make it easy to compare data and use it to tell a story – both of which can help users in decision making.

Data visualization can express data of varying types and sizes: from a few data points to large multivariate datasets. Data visualization can be expressed in different forms. Charts are a common way of expressing data, as they depict different data varieties and allow data comparison.

The type of chart you use depends primarily on two things: the data you want to communicate, and what you want to convey about that data. These guidelines provide descriptions of various different types of charts and their use cases.
